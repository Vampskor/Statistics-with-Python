# # Practice notebook for regression analysis with NHANES
# 
# This notebook will give you the opportunity to perform some
# regression analyses with the NHANES data that are similar to
# the analyses done in the week 2 case study notebook.
# 
# You can enter your code into the cells that say "enter your code here",
# and you can type responses to the questions into the cells that say "Type Markdown and Latex".
# 
# Note that most of the code that you will need to write below is very similar
# to code that appears in the case study notebook.  You will need
# to edit code from that notebook in small ways to adapt it to the
# prompts below.
# 
# To get started, we will use the same module imports and
# read the data in the same way as we did in the case study:

# ## Question 1:
# 
# Use linear regression to relate the expected body mass index (BMI) to a person's age.

# In[ ]:


# enter your code here


# __Q1a.__ According to your fitted model, do older people tend to have higher or lower BMI than younger people?

# __Q1b.__ Based your analysis, are you confident that there is a relationship between BMI and age in the population that NHANES represents?

# __Q1c.__ By how much does the average BMI of a 40 year old differ from the average BMI of a 20 year old?

# __Q1d.__ What fraction of the variation of BMI in this population is explained by age?

# ## Question 2: 
# 
# Add gender and ethnicity as additional control variables to your linear model relating BMI to age.  You will need to recode the ethnic groups based
# on the values in the codebook entry for [RIDRETH1](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/DEMO_I.htm#RIDRETH1).

# In[ ]:


# enter your code here


# __Q2a.__ How did the mean relationship between BMI and age change when you added additional covariates to the model?

# __Q2b.__ How did the standard error for the regression parameter for age change when you added additional covariates to the model?

# __Q2c.__ How much additional variation in BMI is explained by age, gender, and ethnicity that is not explained by age alone?

# __Q2d.__ What reference level did the software select for the ethnicity variable?

# __Q2e.__ What is the expected difference between the BMI of a 40 year-old non-Hispanic black man and a 30 year-old non-Hispanic black man?

# __Q2f.__ What is the expected difference between the BMI of a 50 year-old Mexican American woman and a 50 year-old non-Hispanic black man?

# ## Question 3: 
# 
# Randomly sample 25% of the NHANES data, then fit the same model you used in question 2 to this data set.

# In[ ]:


# enter your code here


# __Q3a.__ How do the estimated regression coefficients and their standard errors compare between these two models?  Do you see any systematic relationship between the two sets of results?

# ## Question 4:
# 
# Generate a scatterplot of the residuals against the fitted values for the model you fit in question 2.

# In[ ]:


# enter your code here


# __Q4a.__ What mean/variance relationship do you see?

# ## Question 5: 
# 
# Generate a plot showing the fitted mean BMI as a function of age for Mexican American men.  Include a 95% simultaneous confidence band on your graph.

# In[ ]:


# enter your code here


# __Q5a.__ According to your graph, what is the longest interval starting at year 30 following which the mean BMI could be constant?  *Hint:* What is the longest horizontal line starting at age 30 that remains within the confidence band?

# __Q5b.__ Add an additional line and confidence band to the same plot, showing the relationship between age and BMI for Mexican American women.  At what ages do these intervals not overlap?

# ## Question 6:
# 
# Use an added variable plot to assess the linearity of the relationship between BMI and age (when controlling for gender and ethnicity).

# In[ ]:


# enter your code here


# __Q6a.__ What is your interpretation of the added variable plot?

# ## Question 7: 
# 
# Generate a binary variable reflecting whether a person has had at least 12 drinks in their lifetime, based on the [ALQ110](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/ALQ_I.htm#ALQ110) variable in NHANES.  Calculate the marginal probability, odds, and log odds of this variable for women and for men.  Then calculate the odds ratio for females relative to males.

# In[ ]:


# enter your code here


# __Q7a.__ Based on the log odds alone, do more than 50% of women drink alcohol?

# __Q7b.__ Does there appear to be an important difference between the alcohol use rate of women and men?

# ## Question 8: 
# 
# Use logistic regression to express the log odds that a person drinks (based on the binary drinking variable that you constructed above) in terms of gender.

# In[ ]:


# enter your code here


# __Q8a.__ Is there statistical evidence that the drinking rate differs between women and men?  If so, in what direction is there a difference?

# __Q8b.__ Confirm that the log odds ratio between drinking and smoking calculated using the logistic regression model matches the log odds ratio calculated directly in question 6.

# ## Question 9: 
# 
# Use logistic regression to relate drinking to age, gender, and education.

# In[ ]:


# enter your code here


# __Q9a.__ Which of these predictor variables shows a statistically significant association with drinking?

# __Q9b.__ What is the odds of a college educated, 50 year old woman drinking?

# __Q9c.__ What is the odds ratio between the drinking status for college graduates and high school graduates (with no college), holding gender and age fixed?

# __Q9d.__ Did the regression parameter for gender change to a meaningful degree when age and education were added to the model?

# ## Question 10:
# 
# Construct a CERES plot for the relationship between drinking and age (using the model that controls for gender and educational attainment).

# In[ ]:


# enter your code here


# __Q10a.__ Does the plot indicate any major non-linearity in the relationship between age and the log odds for drinking?
