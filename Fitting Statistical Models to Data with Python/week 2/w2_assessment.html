# # Week 2 Python Assessment
# 
# This Jupyter Notebook is auxillary to the following assessment in this week.  To complete this assessment, you will complete the 7 questions outlined in this document and use the output from your python cells as answers.
# 
# Your goal of this assignment is to construct regression and logistics models and interpret model paramters.
# 
# Run the following cell to initialize your environment and begin the assessment.

# Now that your notebook is ready, begin answering the questions below.
# 
# ### Questions 1-3
# 
# The first three questions will be utilizing the Boston housing dataset seen in week 1. 
# 
# Here is the description for each column:
# 
# * __CRIM:__ Per capita crime rate by town
# * __ZN:__ Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft
# * __INDUS:__ Proportion of non-retail business acres per town
# * __CHAS:__ Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
# * __NOX:__ Nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million)
# * __RM:__ Average number of rooms per dwelling
# * __AGE:__ Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
# * __DIS:__ Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
# * __RAD:__ Index of accessibility to radial highways
# * __TAX:__ Full-value property tax rate per $\$10,000$
# * __PTRATIO:__ Pupil-teacher ratio by town
# * __B:__ $1000(Bk â€” 0.63)^2$, where Bk is the proportion of [people of African American descent] by town
# * __LSTAT:__ Percentage of lower status of the population
# * __MEDV:__ Median value of owner-occupied homes in $\$1000$s
# 
# Uncomment and run the following code to generate a simple linear regression and output the model summary:

# In[2]:


#model = sm.OLS.from_formula("MEDV ~ RM + CRIM", data=boston)
#result = model.fit()
#result.summary()


# Utilizing the above output, answer the following three questions:
# 
# #### Question 1 (You'll answer this question within the quiz that follows this notebook)
# 
# What is the value of the coefficient for predictor __RM__?
# 
# #### Question 2 (You'll answer this question within the quiz that follows this notebook)
# 
# Are the predictors for this model statistically significant, yes or no? (Hint: What are their p-values?)
# 
# Run the following code for question 3:

# In[3]:


## For Question 3
model = sm.OLS.from_formula("MEDV ~ RM + CRIM + LSTAT", data=boston)
result = model.fit()
result.summary()


# #### Question 3 (You'll answer this question within the quiz that follows this notebook)
# 
# What happened to our R-Squared value when we added the third predictor __LSTAT__ to our initial model?
#   
# 
# #### Question 4 (You'll answer this question within the quiz that follows this notebook)
# 
# What type of model should we use when our target outcome, or dependent variable is continuous?

# ### Questions 5-6
# 
# The next two questions will involve the NHANES dataset.
# 
# Uncomment and run the following code to generate a logistics regression and output the model summary:

# In[ ]:


#model = sm.GLM.from_formula("smq ~ RIAGENDRx + RIDAGEYR + DMDEDUC2x", family=sm.families.Binomial(), data=NHANES)
#result = model.fit()
#result.summary()


# #### Question 5 (You'll answer this question within the quiz that follows this notebook)
# 
# Which of our predictors has the largest coefficient?
# 
# 
# #### Question 6 (You'll answer this question within the quiz that follows this notebook)
# 
# Which values for DMDEDUC2x and RIAGENDRx are represented in our intercept, or what is our reference level?
# 
# 
# #### Question 7 (You'll answer this question within the quiz that follows this notebook)
# 
# What model should we use when our target outcome, or dependent variable is binary, or only has two outputs, 0 and 1.
