1. Write a function that inputs an integers and returns the negative


```python
# Write your function here

```


```python
# Test your function with input x
x = 4
```

2. Write a function that inputs a list of integers and returns the minimum value


```python
# Write your function here

```


```python
# Test your function with input lst
lst = [-3, 0, 2, 100, -1, 2]


# Create you own input list to test with
```

#### Challenge problem:  
Write a function that take in four arguments: lst1, lst2, str1, str2, and returns a pandas DataFrame that has the first column labeled str1 and the second column labaled str2, that have values lst1 and lst2 scaled to be between 0 and 1.

For example
```
lst1 = [1, 2, 3]
lst2 = [2, 4, 5]
str1 = 'one'
str2 = 'two'

my_function(lst1, lst2, str1, str2)
``` 
should return a DataFrame that looks like:



|  <i></i> | one | two |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | .5 | .666 |
| 2 | 1 | 1 |




```python
# test your challenge problem function
import numpy as np

lst1 = np.random.randint(-234, 938, 100)
lst2 = np.random.randint(-522, 123, 100)
str1 = 'one'
str2 = 'alpha'
```
